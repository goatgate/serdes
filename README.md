# SerDes
Operating frequency = 50 Mhz

# Overview
The top module implements a Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) system. It converts 8-bit parallel data into a 10-bit serial format for transmission and then converts it back to the original 8-bit parallel data. This module is particularly useful in high-speed communication applications where minimizing pin count is crucial.
